# LyX Templates for Bachelor/Master Thesis

Here you can find some advanced templates for [LyX](http://www.lyx.org) based on 'koma-script' document classes for your study thesis.

LyX - an open source gui tool - allows you to write your thesis and other complex documents in the **WYSIWYM** method:
*What You See Is What You Mean* - see [lyx.org](http://www.lyx.org)

### History

Since 2002 I started writing a thesis and struggled with Word and LaTeX - both had too many quirks for a pragmatic programmer like me ;) With LyX I found a great compromise of not concerning too much about layouting, but creating highly professional documents for academic use.

With the help of other students (University Rostock, University of applied Sciences Wismar, Wilhelm Büchner Hochschule...) the LyX documents growed and evolved into quite complex templates. These hopefully will be maintained further...

### Status

Currently the templates are just taken from a real german Diploma and a german Master thesis and have to be made more common.

Some documents still contain german texts and have to be translated into English.

- The Master Thesis template is made for University of Applied Science of Wismar, Germany and tested with LyX 2.1.
- The Diploma Thesis template is made for Wilhelm Büchner Hochschule, Germany and tested with LyX 2.1.

### LyX

All templates are created/tested with LyX 2.1 (and higher) under Linux and Windows.

For [Windows](https://wiki.lyx.org/Windows/Windows) the installation of official **LyX-Bundles** is advised - see: https://wiki.lyx.org/Windows/Windows

The bundles contain all needed thirdparty packages like the LaTeX engine [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) and [Ghostscript](http://www.ghostscript.com/).

### JabRef / BibTeX

The embedded bibliography of the LyX templates relies on **literatur.bib** - a [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) file which can be updated with software like [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org). You can use this free Java app or any other app producing BibTeX files.
