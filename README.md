# LyX Templates for Bachelor/Master Thesis

Here you can find some advanced templates for LyX based on 'koma-script' document classes for your study thesis.

LyX - an open source gui tool - allows you to write your thesis and other complex documents in the WYSIWYM method:
What You See Is What You Mean - see http://www.lyx.org

### Status

Currently the templates are just taken from a real german Diploma and a german Master thesis and have to be made more common.

Some documents still contain german texts and have to be translated into English.

The Master Thesis template is made for University of Applied Science of Wismar, Germany and tested with LyX 2.1.

The Diploma Thesis template is made for Wilhelm Büchner Hochschule, Germany and tested with LyX 2.1.

### LyX

All templates are created/tested with LyX 2.x under Linux and Windows.

For Windows the installation of official LyX-Bundles is advised - see: https://wiki.lyx.org/Windows/Windows
